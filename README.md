# WoH-SpriteChecker

This is a simple python program that checks every pixel of your sprite and determine if their color is correct.

As you may (should) know, the game has a strict palette and your pixels must be one of the defined colors, otherwise transparency/color mapping will not work correctly.

This program detects any pixel that do not match any of the defined colors and convert them to the closest one. 

**Note that as of current version, it can only check 1-bit character sprites. **

## Palette Definition

Currently, the color palette of character sprites is defined as:

1. pure black ( RGB( 0 , 0, 0 ) or HSV( 0, 0, 0 ) )
2. pure white ( RGB( 255, 255, 255 ) or HSV( 0, 0 , 255 ))
3. color at the bottom-left corner of the sprite (regarded by the game as transparent)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:  though you may use any color as transparency color, when distinguishing between pure white and transparent color, the program checks by saturation value . This means that your transparency color should be as saturated as possible (at least >127).

## Usage

Depending on your preference, you can download the zip file from standalone and run the program without the need of Python environment, or you can simply grab the source code if you have Python and **OpenCV** installed. The standalone version is huge since it bundles with OpenCV. The standalone version is also built on Windows and will only work on Windows. 

### Using Standalone
0. Download and unzip the standalone file
1. put all your sprites in the folder containing the readme file
2. goto the SpriteChecker folder and launch SpriteChecker.exe, the program will display information on whether pixels are corrected.
3. corrected sprites are stored in a folder named "corrected" under the folder containing the readme file.

### Using Python script (source)
0. Make sure you have Python and OpenCV package installed.
1. Download the source file from the src folder. Put it somewhere.
2. Put your sprites under the same folder as the source file.
3. Run the script using command line. The resulting sprites are stored in the "corrected" folder under the path containing the source file.
